            <li>To prepare this easy recipe, take a deep-bottomed pan and add enough water to it along with eggs. Let the eggs boil for 10 minutes. After the eggs boil, drain the water and let the eggs cool down a little. Now peel the eggs and chop them roughly.</li>
            <li>Take a bowl and add the chopped eggs, mayonnaise, salt, mustard paste to the bowl and mix thoroughly. Add pepper powder to the mixture and mix again to form the filling.</li>
            <li>Toast the bread slices using a little oil on pan and add the egg mixture to the bread. Cover it up with the other bread slice to prepare a sandwich. Make more such sandwiches with the leftover mixture and bread slices and serve.</li>
