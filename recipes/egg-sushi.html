        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Mirin</li>
            <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Nori (Seaweed Sheets)</li>
            <li>Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>Sushi Vinegar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the washed rice and water to the rice cooker, cooking according to instructions. Once cooked, transfer to a large bowl. When it’s still very warm (not too hot), stir in the sushi vinegar and mix.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk together water, rice vinegar, sugar and mirin until sugar is dissolved. Combine the egg mixture with the seasoning mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat a rectangular tamagoyaki pan (you can also use a round pan, see recipe notes) over medium heat. Then dip a folded paper towel in oil, and apply to the pan. Once the oil is hot, pour a thin layer of the seasoned egg mixture in the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the liquid to flow to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <li>After the egg has set a little bit but still soft on the surface, start rolling it into a log shape. Add more oil and then pour another layer of egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>When this new layer has set slightly and still soft on the top, start rolling the log back onto the set egg to the other end of the pan.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until you’ve used all the egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Remove from the pan and place the tamagoyaki on a sushi mat. Wrap it up and shape the tamagoyaki when it’s still hot. Let it rest for about 5 minutes. Slice the tamagoyaki into 12 pieces, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut the nori seaweed into ¼-inch wide strips. Take 3/4 handful cooked rice and shape it to a long oval form.</li>
            <li>Place a piece of tamagoyaki on the rice, and then press it firmly to sick on the rice. Wrap the nori strip around the width of the sushi to secure the tamagoyaki to the rice. Place the assembled Tamago sushi on the plate. Serve and enjoy!</li>
